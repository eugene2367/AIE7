              "'People often fail to pay back their loans due to several interconnected reasons highlighted in the complaints:\\n\\n1. **Lack of Clear Information and Communication:** Borrowers report being inadequately informed about their loan status, payment resumption dates, transfer of loans between servicers, or changes in payment requirements. For example, some complaints mention not being notified about loan transfers or the start of repayment, leading to surprise delinquencies.\\n\\n2. **Compounding and Accumulating Interest:** Many borrowers describe how interest continues to accrue during forbearance or deferment periods, sometimes negating any payments made. This makes it difficult to pay down the actual principal and extends the repayment timeline, discouraging borrowers.\\n\\n3. **Difficulty Affording Payments:** A common theme is that borrowers cannot increase monthly payments without sacrificing essential living expenses like food, rent, or transportation. The repayment plans often do not account for their financial hardship, rendering them unable to keep up.\\n\\n4. **Issues with Loan Servicers and Payment Management:** Complaints include problems with applying additional funds toward principal, mismanagement of loans, or servicers applying payments in a way that favors interest accumulation. Sometimes, payments are misapplied or delayed, leading to delinquency.\\n\\n5. **Unmanaged or Misleading Loan Processes:** Some borrowers did not realize they had to repay loans or were misled about their obligations. Others faced surprises like loan transfers without proper notification or a lack of documented breakdowns of their balances and interest.\\n\\n6. **Economic Hardship and Unemployment:** Several complaints mention unemployment, low wages, and financial hardship, which make consistent repayment unmanageable, especially when combined with stagnant wages and high living costs.\\n\\n7. **Problems with Delays and Errors in Payment Handling:** Instances of loans being reported as delinquent or late payments due to administrative errors, such as not receiving proper notices, or the servicer reporting delinquency without proper communication, have also contributed to repayment difficulties.\\n\\n8. **Impact of Financial Hardships:** Some borrowers did not take on excessive debt irresponsibly; rather, they were misled, faced economic downturns, or were caught in complicated loan management systems that hindered their ability to pay.\\n\\nIn summary, failures to repay loans are often driven by a combination of poor communication, complicated interest accrual, economic hardship, and administrative mismanagement, rather than a lack of willingness or responsibility on the part of borrowers.'"

        "   - Dense‑vector models embed each reformulation at a slightly different spot in embedding space.  \n",

        "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
        "\n",

        "- Return big documents\n",
