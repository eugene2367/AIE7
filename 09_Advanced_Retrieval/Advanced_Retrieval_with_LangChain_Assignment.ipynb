        "   - A single phrasing may use words that never appear in the corpus.  \n",
        "   - Paraphrases swap in synonyms or domain‑specific jargon, so at least one version shares tokens with the relevant chunk → higher chance of a BM25 / hybrid hit.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hits diverse semantic neighborhoods**  \n",
        "   - Dense‑vector models embed each reformulation at a slightly different spot in embedding space.  \n",
        "   - When you query with all of them and **union** the top‑k results, you sweep a broader radius around the user’s intent, surfacing documents that any one vector might have missed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Balances granularity**  \n",
        "   - Long, detailed questions can be broken into *atomic sub‑queries* (“Who?”, “When?”, “Why?”).  \n",

        "4. **Mitigates mistakes in user wording**  \n",
        "   - Typos, wrong acronyms, or partial product names in the original query get corrected in some reformulations, rescuing what would otherwise be a miss.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Reduces recall variance across corpora**  \n",

        "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

        "- Return big documents\n",
